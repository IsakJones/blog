How do we really learn? The question may sound abstract, but I believe that all our educational institutions hold a distinct idea of what constitutes learning, no matter how hidden it might be.
<!--end_of_excerpt-->
The Italian university system is a great example. In Italy, most courses have a straightforward structure: in the first half, students attend long lectures taking copious notes, then in the second half they review their notes and study one or more related textbooks for a final exam. Notably, the final exam often determines 100% of the course's grade, and is usually multiple-question, testing student's retention of knowledge. I know this because I grew up in Italy and most of my college-educated friends went or are going through this system. Despite no one telling me, the Italian educational system seems to revolve around the distinct idea that people learn by absorbing information from professors in classes or from textbooks, and that the resulting knowledge consists in recalling the absorbed information.

Of course, I'm overgeneralizing a little bit. Some friends in engineering and architecture have had more project-oriented academic assessments. Others in medicine and nursing have held mandatory interships in their local hospitals. But that doesn't take away from the overarching idea of how the mind processes information and crystallizes learning. 

In an excellent essay, [Why Books Don't Work](https://andymatuschak.org/books/),  Andy Matuschak makes the case that a similar idea underlies a much more primitive and widespread educational institution: the non-fiction book. Books, he points out, implicitly rely on a model of transmission-based learning, where the reader passively absorbs information contained in the text. As the title suggests, this doesn't work - Matuschak embarassingly admits that he rarely reads a book and absorbs what amounts to more than a few sentences. Even worse, he realizes that it's not until forced introspection that he realizes how little he understood in the first place. 

This lack of understanding from non-fiction books is, I feel, quite a tabboo. Matuschak notes the embarassment of his friends when they admit to the same, but instead of embarassment I've most often observed frustration and denial. Books, as Matuschak notes, are time-consuming mediums, requiring hours of careful reading. After putting in so much effort, the last thing someone wants to hear, or admit, is that those many hours amounted to very little. This tabboo is rooted in the same idea: if books effectively impart learning through transmission, admitting poor learning is equivalent to admitting stupidity. Hence embarassment, frustration, and denial.

It's quite a pessimistic view of non-fiction books that I don't entirely agree with, because I think that books go beyond information transmission. They are a great resource to bounce ideas off of brilliant minds with unique expertise across time and space. In fact, as an avid non-fiction reader myself, I've most enjoyed many books not for the value of their information, but for the intellectual challenge of their ideas and the way they clashed with mine, sparking engaging reading experiences that feel more like discussions than lectures.

Books are also a great reference for knowledge. They provide an amazingly researched reference for hypotheses, statements, and paradigms that explicitly map to other texts. Of course, this is only possible with modern publishing institutions, which assure quality and faithfulness, and modern academic institutions, which spur much of the research and debate that inspire many of today's best non-fiction books.

I'm also somewhat sceptical that the book as a medium is solely responsible for poor learning. Another hypothesis, maybe scarier, is that most people actually don't read non-fiction books, or at least not as closely as they know they should, and then lie about it. It's a cynical hypothesis, but it can explain poor understanding, and it is testable. Hence in the last chapter of [Everybody Lies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seth_Stephens-Davidowitz#Everybody_Lies), data scientist Seth Stephens-Davidowitz argues that based on his analysis of Amazon book quotes, only about 7% of readers get to the end of [Thinking, Fast and Slow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow), which Matuschak mentions numerous times. Of course, more research should confirm this hypothesis, but it's an interesting possibility nonetheless.

Ultimately, though, I mostly agree with Matuschak, and think that, for one reason or another, books are ineffective pedagogical tools. I've also recently started sharing his fascination for spaced-repetition. For the past few weeks, I've been using flash-card app [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/), and I've already seen noticible improvements in my ability to use the command line, which involves quite a bit of memorization. My hope is that, maybe, spaced-repetition tools like Anki can improve the ability to learn from books.
