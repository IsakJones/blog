Pursuing a career in software engineering was not an easy choice. When I committed to the career switch, I had just graduated from university in a non-technical subject without any formal training in programming or connections in the tech industry.

Moreover, I was academically accomplished in International Relations and I had landed internships at respected institutions in the field, so I was not without alternatives. Despite my circumstances, three reasons spurred the change to software engineering: 
1. Intellectual challenge
2. Quality of life
3. Positive impact

**I find programming deeply intellectually engaging.** Ever since I wrote my first line of code in June 2020, I've found few activities to be as engrossing. Because of that, I committed to programming in my spare time the following summer, despite studying full-time and working part-time. It took me a while to accept that I much preferred programming to the type of research I conducted in my internships, thanks in part to my partner, who never failed to point out my delight when solving a bug, exploring a computer science concept, or writing a working script out of a fun idea. When I focus on how much I enjoy programming as an activity, switching careers feels natural.

**I believe that tech jobs lead to better quality of life (and work).** Everyone knows that programmers in the US tend to earn more money and enjoy more benefits compared to many of their peers outside of tech. But what really attracted me to tech is that it only values hard work as much as smart work, and I don't think this is true in many other industries. I would say that professional services (finance, consulting, PR, etc.) fetishize hard work: young analysts are routinely pressured to work long hours despite waning productivity and even health risks, and older executives justify the pressure as a necessary rite of passage. Personally, I would never want to work hard purely for the sake of it, and I would much prefer an environment that values working smart when it gets the job done, so I think tech is a better fit.

**I am convinced that building good software can have lasting positive impact.** Ultimately, I believe that much of what determines our quality of life is the sum of goods and services that we have access to. If a service becomes cheaper, consumers should have more money to spend on other goods and services that can improve their standard of living. Hence improving the price, quality, or accessibility of goods and services can have a lasting and positive impact on people's lives. Given that so many of these goods nowadays are digital, and given that digitization is not slowing down, I think that building good software has the potential to improve living standards more than most other careers.
