Outline:

 - Intro

 - My excitement - Java

Object orientation had never clicked with me in Python
In Java, it felt quite cohesive, as (almost) everything is an object, even the main function
I got excited about the sophistication of oo elements including interfaces, absract classes, static methods, etc.
Moreover, I felt like object orientation provided a layer of abstraction that mirrors our ways of thinking, with 
categories that have instances with properties that can be changed.

 - Applying oo principles: Space Invaders

So when I programmed a space invaders game, I wanted to write a radically oo program, where everything was an object.
Because of that, the project is like a java project, where each file in the src package is a class.
But I realized that there were many issues leading to boilerplate and tough design decisions.

 - Modularity might be a better solution

 - Sendoff: my takeaways so far, but I'll probably program in oo for longer and learn more

In this blog post, I discuss my experience and the lessons learned, which are:

 - Modularity will often be better than oo
 - Use classes only when necessary
 - Be thoughtful about their design (separation of concerns)
