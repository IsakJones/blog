In this blog post, I'll summarize what a Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) is, and the consequences it has on languages like Python.

Only one thread can be executed at a time, despite the fact that python threads are pthreads, which are managed and shceduled by the OS.

It uses the GIL for memory safety, so that different threads don't access memory unsafely.
Benefits:
 - Makes non-thread-safe C extensions easier to integrate in Python
 - Makes garbase collector cohesive with reference counting
