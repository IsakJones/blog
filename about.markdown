I'm an aspiring software engineer looking for a junior role. I'm most interested in backend development, and I am particularly passionate about fintech, but my priority is finding a role where I can learn, be challenged, and deliver concrete results. I'm currently attending the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com), a selective, self-directed, community-driven educational retreat for programmers.

I've mostly coded in Go, Python, and Java, and used tools such as Git, Github, and PostgreSQL. I'm currently working on a payments processor API, [Polka](https://www.github.com/IsakJones/polka). I'm also passionate about developing a well-rounded [computer science education](https://www.teachyourselfcs.com) - I've mainly studied algorithms and networking, but I'm also familiar with the basics of other topics, including databases, concurrency, operating systems, programming paradigms, and computer architecture. Currently, I'm obsessed with:
 - HTTP(3)
 - Algorithms 
 - CPU virtualization
 - Functional programming in Haskell

I was completely self-taught before this Fall, when I joined the Recurse Center and became part of a community of passionate and experienced programmers. Before pursuing a career in software engineering, I graduated from college in Philosophy and International Relations and held a few internships in foreign policy. Outside of programming, I'm passionate about cooking, fitness, and foreign languages.
